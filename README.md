# RESCUE HEALTH

**Rescue health is application,** 
where entered data shows the nearest Hospital and track to him. Application can send SMS with track to '112', '997' numbers and informs about needed help.


**How this works?**
This is page with selenium bot on server. When user will enter data, bot is going to search the nearest hospital in area on 'https://www.google.pl/maps/', where user need help. If location exists he would redirect to google map tracker after some seconds. Furthermore informs health services if user wants.


**transport types in app to select:**
* walk
* car

**I decided to make this app with selenium,**
Why? I didn't want use Credentials on Google Map API.

*I learn how make responsive page for smartphones and how use flexbox. These were the most important things why I did this app*
